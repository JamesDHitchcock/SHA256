# SHA256
This code was written as part of a cryptography class that I attended that I look back at fondly because it was interesting and challenging at the time to re-write the SHA-256 hash in C++.

Sha.cpp takes a string from command line and outputs the hash to cmd while TortAndHare is an excercise that was part of an assignment to show how many iterations it would take before the SHA-256 algorithm would loop on itself using our first name and month born.
